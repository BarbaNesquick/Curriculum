## User Profile
The profile I've used for my project is my own profile.

## Information Architecture
	First of all, I  show a title with my name show my name in the title, as it is one of the 
	most important points of the curriculum.
	Then, I decided to show my studies and permits in the left and my profile in the right, this 
	way one can read both without having to waste any time, as them both are pretty related, and 
	should be read together because they complement each other.
	Under the profile is a photo of mine, so they can see who I am, and under the studies there
	are the languages I can speak. The languages are under my studies and permits because they
	also are studies in their own way.
	The last thing is my contact information, because that's probably the last thing they will read,
	mainly because the contact information is useless if they don't know about my studies and 
	background.
## Visual Design
	I'm really bad at visual design, so I tried to keep it simple. First of all, everything is
	inside a container. Both the containerr and the backgrounds have round cornes to be more visually
	apealling. 
	Because I don't really know about color pallete's, I decided to use one from a web.
	I also wanted to try using strong's for the studies list, to make it more shocking and draw the
	atention to it.
	Finally, I decided to use roman numbers in one of the lists because it's more visually apealling.
